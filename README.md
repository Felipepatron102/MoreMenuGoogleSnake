# MoreMenuGoogleSnake
Adaptation of Google snake mod menu (moremenu.html) from https://github.com/darksnakegang

! THIS IS NOT MY SCRIPT, I SIMPLY REPLACED SOME IMAGES, IT WORKS AS THE NORMAL MOD !

Credit is to https://github.com/darksnakegang

DIRECTIONS:


Import MoreMenu.html (found in releases) into bookmarks manager.
Once imported, make sure bookmarks bar is visible.
Open Google Snake and click the script, wait 3-5 seconds and go to settings, the modded items should appear.
